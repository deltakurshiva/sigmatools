This repository contains tools used for the SIGMA LOOP online radio.

Currently it contains a Xbox 360 MIDI mapping for [MidiHID](http://www.polhosting.info/web-archives/midihid/), a [Mixxx](http://mixxx.org/) MIDI controller that can receive from it, and a work-in-progress direct Mixxx HID scheme for that controller.
The Icecast/ directory contains a script that can be ran to convert OGG streaming input from e.g. Traktor to MP3 on-server. It was adapted from [the script at IWTF](http://iwtf.net/2010/01/04/linux-ogg-and-mp3-streaming-server/) to also parse and send metadata; for more instructions, see their article.
It also contains a shell script that adds a nice BGM to any OSX application.
